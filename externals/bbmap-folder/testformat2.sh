Description:  Reads the entire file to find extended information about the format and contents.

Usage:  testformat2.sh <file>


Parameters:

full=t          Process the full file.
speed=f         Print processing time.

printjunk=f     Print headers of junk reads to stdout.
printbarcodes=f Print barcodes to stdout.
printqhist=f    Print quality histogram to stdout.
printihist=f    Print insert size histogram to stdout.

bhistlen=10k    bhist.txt will be calculated from reads up to this length.
                To allow all reads, set to 0.

merge=t         Calculate mergability via BBMerge.
sketch=t        (card) Calculate cardinality via BBSketch.
                If enabled, also sends the sketch to the refseq server.
trim=t          Calculate trimmability from quality.


File output parameters (these can be eliminated by setting to null):

junk=junk.txt          Print headers of junk reads to this file.
barcodes=barcodes.txt  Print barcodes to this file.
qhist=qhist.txt        Print quality histogram to this file.
ihist=ihist.txt        print insert size histogram to this file.
