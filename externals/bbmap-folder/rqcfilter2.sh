Description:  RQCFilter2 is a revised version of RQCFilter that uses a common path for all dependencies.
The dependencies are available at http://portal.nersc.gov/dna/microbial/assembly/bushnell/RQCFilterData.tar

Performs quality-trimming, artifact removal, linker-trimming, adapter trimming, and spike-in removal using BBDuk.
Performs human/cat/dog/mouse/microbe removal using BBMap.
It requires 40 GB RAM for mousecatdoghuman, but only 1GB or so without them.

Usage:  rqcfilter2.sh in=<input file> path=<output directory> rqcfilterdata=<path to RQCFilterData directory>

Primary I/O parameters:
in=<file>           Input reads.
in2=<file>          Use this if 2nd read of pairs are in a different file.
path=null           Set to the directory to use for all output files.

Reference file paths:
rqcfilterdata=      Path to unzipped RQCFilterData directory.  Default is /global/projectb/sandbox/gaag/bbtools/RQCFilterData
ref=<file,file>     Comma-delimited list of additional reference files for filtering via BBDuk.

Output parameters:
scafstats=scaffoldStats.txt  Scaffold stats file name (how many reads matched which reference scaffold) .

*****   All additional parameters supported by BBDuk may also be used, and will be passed directly to BBDuk   *****
